# Concord Ping Pong App

Hey!

Feel free to submit PRs to make this app better.

## Goals:
- [ ] wip - Make use of Raspberry Pi with Touchscreen to start new game and see current score
- [ ] wip - Use a USB encoder connected to arcade buttons so the score can be incremented, decremented and start a new game with defaults.  The buttons will emulate key presses.
- [ ] Ability to add player names to a game
- [ ] Create scoreboard page that shows the score of the current game that can be shown on the tv in the ping pong room.
- [ ] Connect app to firebase so anyone can visit a webpage to see active game score or reserve table
- [ ] Slack bot to see table availability/current game score
- [ ] Tournament generator
- [ ] Slack bot tournament generator
- [ ] Slack notifications when it's your turn to play



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
